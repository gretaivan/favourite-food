                    A popular caricature of Mongol warriors—called Tatars or Tartars—has them tenderizing meat under their saddles, then eating it raw. This story was popularized by Jean de Joinville in the 13th century.[4] But Joinville never encountered Mongols himself and used this as a way of showing that they were uncivilized.[5] It is possible that this story was a confusion originating in the use of thin slices of meat to protect saddle sores from further rubbing.[6]

                    In the late 19th century, the Hamburg steak became popular on the menus of many restaurants in the port of 
                    New York. This kind of fillet was beef minced by hand, lightly salted and often smoked, and usually served 
                    raw in a dish along with onions and bread crumbs.[7][8] Hamburg steak gained popularity because of its ease 
                    of preparation and decreasing cost. This is evident from its detailed description in some of the most popular
                     cookbooks of the day.[9]
